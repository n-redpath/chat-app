Important thing to know while grading:
- When in a room, if you want to see "user options" (send private message, ban, etc), you need to click on the button with that user's name on it. 

Creative Portion:
We did two things for our creative portion - transfer admin and unban user. For transfer admin, when the admin of a room selects another user in that room, they have the option to transfer administrative power to that user. The new admin can then kick out, ban, unban, and transfer admin to whoever they want, and the original admin loses those powers. These changes go into effect once the original admin and the new admin "click away", i. e. once the original and new admins click on another user button. It also updates the admin of the room in the room's welcome message.

For unban user, the admin has the power to unban a user that they previously banned. When they ban a user, that user shows up on the "banned users" list in the room that only the admin can see. The admin can then click the "unban user" button and then the originally banned user will be able to log back into the room.
